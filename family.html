				The picture above was taken during <i>"Hari Raya Aidilfitri"</i> this year, 2021. <br> 
				Everyone was so happy at that time eventhough we have to celebrate Eids at home. <br>
				We can't go back to the hometown due to COVID-19 pandemic but it's okay as long as <br>
				we still get to celebrate it together. <br><br>
				
				Now, let me introduce you to my family. Let's start with my father.<br>
				My father's name is Nasri bin Saud and I called him "Abah". Abah is the most loving<br>
				person that I have ever known in my life. There is nobody can love me as much as how he did.<br>
				I really adores my dad as he work so hard to make sure that his family get the best out of the best. <br>
				He never complained eventhough I know it is hard for him but he always care about his family. <br>
				Same goes to my mother. My mother's name is Suriza binti Yahaya and I called her "Mama". <br>
				She is such a loving mother to all of her children. She is the strongest woman that I have ever met.<br>
				There is no word could describe how much I love both of them. <br> <br>
				
				Next, we move on to my siblings. I have 5 siblings including me. <br>
				Each of them has a very different personality that it is very hard to tell. <br>
				My first sister, Nurul or I called her "Kaklong". She is currently working as the nurse <br>
				at Hospital Shah Alam. I can say that she is very independent and very passionate in doing her work. <br>
				She also very caring and always offer for a help. Next, we move to my second sister who I called as "Kakngah". <br>
				Kakngah is fierce person yet she also a loving person. She is currently working as admin in UiTM Puncak Alam. <br>
				I really adores her in studies. She is very clever and she always share her knowledge with the other siblings <br>
				which is the thing that I really like about her. She also always help me in my studies. <br><br>
				
				My little sister, Riesya or I also called her "Ica". She is turning 16 on 2022 and she is the <br>
				only siblings that went to a boarding school. Eventhough that I rarely meet her, <br>
				but when we get to meet each other...everything will goes crazy. <br>
				She is such a crackhead person that always makes me laugh to death. <br>
				Thanks to her for always made my day brighter. <br><br>

				And lastly, my little brother who I called Daniel or "Onion". <br>
				I don't know how did he get that nickname but somehow I think it is kinda cute. <br>
				He is my one and only little brother that I have in my life and the only "hero" among the siblings. <br>
				He loves to make me feel annoyed but then I still love him. Sometimes, he is quite clingy since he was <br>
				the youngest in the family. Yeah, he got the ticket but as a siblings, we always <br>
				received the same amount of love from both of our parents and I love my family so much! <br><br>
