				This is my bestfriends! From the right side is Syaidatul or so called Syai, next is Hadirah <br>
				or i called her Dirah and lastly it's me. I know both of them since we were in primary school.<br>
				I get to know Hadirah first when we were in Standard 1. At that time we were in the same class <br>
				and I was a very shy student and got no friend at that time. Hadirah was the only one that approach me<br>
				and want to make friends with me. I was so happy at that time since there is someone wannna be my friend.<br>
				We became friends ever since then. She was very kind, helpful and always there whenever I need her. <br>
				As for Syaidatul, we get to know each other when were in Standard 6. We were in the same class but we rarely <br>
				talk to each other. However, we moved to the same secondary school and we were in the same class since<br>
				Form 1 until Form 3. Hadirah wasn't in the same school with us since she went to boarding school. However, <br>
				Hadirah later moved to our school in 2016 and coincidentally, we were in the same class again! Since then, Hadirah <br>
				started to get closer to Syaidatul too. After that, three of us started to share stories, study and recess together and <br>
				that is how we become best friends. We always share secret between the three of us and we really trust each others. <br>
				Even after school, we are still bestfriends and always hangout together. <br> I really hope that this friendship will stay forever until the rest <br>
				of our life because i love them both so much! <br> <br> </p></b></i></td>
