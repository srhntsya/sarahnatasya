				The first experience that I would like to share with you guys is the solar cooking competition that I joined during high school. <br>
				The competition was organised by my Science teacher, Mrs. Mariam Omar. It is a science experiment competition which student required <br>
				to use their creativity to heat the water by using solar only. We weren’t allowed to heat the water using fire stove or what so ever. <br>
				Team that has the highest temperature of water will be announced as the winner of this competition. We need to form a group consist <br>
				of 3 person only and I’m group with my friends, Izzah and Firzani. We joined this competition because we feel that it is very interesting <br>
				and we also love Science! During the competition, my team decided to create a bowl using aluminium foil and we put it inside a black box and <br>
				it was covered by a transparent plastic which at the top of it, we put magnifying glass. We put the box under the direct sunlight. <br>
				We were given 1 hour to heat the water and after that the judges will come and check the temperature. Guess what? Our team won the first place <br>
				since we managed to get the highest temperature. It was very unexpected and we were so happy! ;) <br></font></p>

				My second experience that I would love to share is about my internship! During my diploma, students are compulsory to go through <br>
				industrial training for 6 weeks during semester 3. As I’m taking Diploma in Library Management, I need to do my internship at any libraries in <br>
				Malaysia so I chose library in Polytechnic Shah Alam,  Selangor so called Ibnu Khaldun library as it near to my house. <br>
				My internship experience was really fun since I have my friend, Seri doing internship together at the same place with me. <br>
				We also went to work together everyday. There are so many things that I learned during my internship such as we get to experience <br>
				the real working environment, improving my communication skills with the customers and learned to do office works. <br>
				Even though it is only 6 weeks, but I can say that I have gained many experiences and knowledge there. All the staffs over there are<br>
				very kind and they accept me just the way I am. The woman at the middle in the picture is the chief librarian of this library, Mrs. Norhayati. <br>
				She is very soft and kind hearted person. She also very care about all of her staffs. <br><br>

				One of experience that I will never forget is when I joined innovation competition named ISAIID during my Diploma in UiTM Kedah. <br>
				ISAIID is stand for International Student Affairs Invention, Innovation and Design Competition. It was a great experience to be in this team <br>
				where we work so hard to win the competition. However, the competitors are from all over the country and it was very competitive competition but my <br>
				team managed to get bronzer! :) Eventhough it is just bronzer, but we still felt that our hard work paid off.<br> <br>
