				I have never thought in my life that I will ever meet all of these people! I don't think that I can replace them <br>
				and all the memories with anything else in this world. They are just great classmates ever during my diploma years. <br> 
				It has been 2 years since the last time we all meet each other and i miss them so much. <br>
				They are my laughing gas in the class and college. There are so many college activities that we have done together. <br>
				Every morning, we will walked to class together and after class, we will go eat lunch at <br>
				one of the restaurant in front of UiTM Kedah. Omg, that was sooo nostalgic too me, what a very good old days :( <br>
				If only i can turn back the times, I wanna rewind the time when we have to stay up late at night together <br>
				in the discussion room just to finish the assignment. It sounds weird to go back to the "stressful" time but <br>
				believe or not, that was the best. We also always "lepak" in the library together and just chill over there <br>
				while waiting for the next class. Not to mention when we always hang out to the shopping mall nearest to buy our <br>
				essential during weekends. We had a really great time but then pandemic happened. We don't really get to spend our <br>
				last final semester together but it's okay! I hope that we get to meet each other during our graduation day!
